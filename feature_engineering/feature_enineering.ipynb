    "Feature engineering involves a combination of domain knowledge, statistical analysis, and creativity. Some common techniques used in feature engineering include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Feature scaling: Scaling the features to a similar range can help improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Feature extraction: transforming the raw data into new features that are more informative and relevant for the problem at hand using a technique like principal component analysis (PCA), wavelet transforms, and Fourier transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Feature selection: This involves selecting a subset of the original features that are most relevant to the problem to reduce the dimensionality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Feature transformation: This involves transforming the data in a way that highlights certain patterns or relationships. Examples of feature transformation techniques include logarithmic and exponential transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Feature combination: This involves combining multiple features to create a new, more informative feature. Examples of feature combination techniques include creating interaction terms, polynomial features, and binning."
